# Microplastics-16S-Sequence-Analysis
This project contains the RMarkdown code for the full analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence data for the microplastics project. The data files are contained in the QIIME output folder, and the code that was run to get this processed data from the raw sequence data is detailed in QIIME2 workflow.docx. The Final figures folder containes the main and supplementary figures and tables produced for the manuscript.
